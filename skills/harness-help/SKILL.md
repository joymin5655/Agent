# /harness-help

You don't remember every skill, so ask. Most work travels one **main flow**;
everything else is standalone. Each skill below is documented in its own
`skills/<name>/SKILL.md` — this router only says *when to reach for which*.

## The main flow: idea → shipped

1. **`/spec <slug>`** — turn a fuzzy request into `spec.md` + `plan.md` under
   `.agent/plans/<slug>/`, then route to plan approval (ExitPlanMode). Add
   `--interview` when the request is fuzzy enough that a wrong guess would
   commit the spec to the wrong shape. Approval is what unlocks editing —
   `spec-gate` stops asking once the plan-approval flag exists.
2. **`/supervise <slug>`** — run the approved plan wave by wave, dispatching
   specialists per the delegation contract and auditing after each wave.
   `--goal-mode` for budgeted, resumable runs.
3. **`/verify-completion <claim>`** — before accepting any "done": a fresh
   context re-checks the claim mechanically, then a refute-by-default judge.
   `/supervise` calls this at its completion step; reach for it directly
   whenever a builder's word is the only evidence.
4. **`/wrap`** — commit + PR with the safety gates (gitleaks, risk areas)
   intact. `--auto-push` / `--auto-merge` are opt-in escalations.

A single small edit needs none of this — just make the edit; the gates scope
trivial work out by design.

## Standalone

- **`/harness-audit`** — read-only health check of the harness itself: one
  `verify-all.sh` dry-run, a per-check table, the doc-reality verdict named.
  Run it before a release or after a structural change.
- **`/project-init`** (command) — scaffold a consumer project with
  `CLAUDE.md`, rules, and `gitleaks.toml`.

## The gates underneath

Skills are the methodology; hooks are the enforcement. When one interrupts you
mid-flow, it names its own escape:

- **spec-gate** asks for a plan on a substantive edit → run `/spec`.
- **tdd-guard** blocks new prod code with no failing test → write the test first.
- **pre-tool-guard / risk-area mutexes** stop destructive or contested
  operations → the user drives those; don't route around them.

## Keeping this router honest

Any skill added to or removed from `skills/` updates this file in the same
commit — a router that lies is worse than no router.
